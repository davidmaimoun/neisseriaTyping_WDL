Neisseria Typing WDL

The script take as input all the fastas in the "assemblies" folder
It will run the docker image "neisseria_typing", containing:
	- A serogroup search step (call the charactiriza_capsule from the CDC)
	- A typing step (MLST, BAST, MenDeVar etc)
	- A merging step: since the programs run in parallele, we want the merge the
	  outputs to get one report, typing + serogrouping

** For now the neisseria_typing image is in my dockerhub repo 'davidmaimoun' until further
** instructions (when will move to Terra.Bio)
